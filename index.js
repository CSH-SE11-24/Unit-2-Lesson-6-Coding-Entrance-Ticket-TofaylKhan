// In this entrance ticket, you will be building a "guess the number" game. 
// Create a new variable and put a number from 1-100 in
let nums = 70


// Prompt the user to guess the number
let guess = prompt("Guess the number")


// Cast the user input to a number
const usrinput = 30



// Create a new variable called attempts and set it to 0
let attempts = 0


// Create a while loop that runs while the user guess is not equal to your number
while ("guess" <30){
  console.log("Try again")
}


// In the while loop, prompt the user to guess the number again (remember to cast)


// In the while loop, increase the attempts by 1
guess++


// In the while loop, write an if statement that does the following
// If the user guess is higher, say "Too high!"
// If the user guess is lower, say "Too low!"
// If the user guess is right, say "You got it!"
 if( guess === high){
  console.log("Too High")
   let high = 30
}
if( userguess === low){
  console.log("Too low")
  let low = 10
}

if( guess === Correct){
  console.log("You got it ")
  let correct  = 70
}



// After the while loop, print "It took (attempts) attempts" 
console.log("it took (attempts) attempts")
